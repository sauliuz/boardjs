## Dashing App

This project is NodeJS version of the [popular Dashing dashboard application](http://dashing.io/). 
The original port to JavaScript / NodeJS runtime was made in [dashing-js](https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js) (which is not maintained anymore).

The goal of this Dashing-app project is to keep the minimal, up to date version of the example dashboard.
It removes the complexity and unnecesary dependencies.
